# WP-CLI API

An API to manipulate an WordPress installation by code. This project is an interface to WP-CLI. It manipulate the core, plugins, themes, options and another data wrapping with the CLI calls.

The WP-CLI is an excellent tool to maintain WordPress sites. However the unique way of execute your code is in the terminal. Itâ€™s impossible access directly the project functions to use with another application. For example, to get a status of a plugin.

The objective of the project is solve this. Through of entity classes to represent site objects and helper classes to manipulate the packages and data. Using the WP-CLI as background to get the data and execute tasks.

This project doesn't support multisite installation and interactive commands.
